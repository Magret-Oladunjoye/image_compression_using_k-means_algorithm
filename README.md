# image_comression_using_k-means_algorithm
Using the k-means algorithm, the 24-bit-color representation of an image was compressed to minimize its byte size. 
Each pixel in the image is represented as three 8-bit unsigned integers ranging from 0-255 and our image contains thousands of colors. 
I reduced this number to 16 colors by choosing 16 clusters for the clustering algorithm.
