# image_comression_using_k-means_algorithm
This task involved the compression of a 24-bit-color representation of an image.
Each pixel in the image is represented as three 8-bit unsigned integers ranging from 0-255 and our image contains thousands of colors. 
I reduced this number to 16 colors with the help of k-means clustering algorithms by selecting 16 clusters that best group the pixels in the 3D RGB space.
